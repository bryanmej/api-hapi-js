A tutorial for Sitepoint on [building JSON API's with Hapi]().

> Today, we'll be building the following API for a typical blog from scratch:

```
GET     /articles                articles#index
GET     /articles/:id            articles#show
POST    /articles                articles#create
PUT     /articles/:id            articles#update
DELETE  /articles/:id            articles#destroy
POST    /articles/:id/comments   comments#create
DELETE  /articles/:id/comments   comments#destroy
POST    /authentications         authentications#create
```
